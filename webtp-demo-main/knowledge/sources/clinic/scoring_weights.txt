PROVIDER SCORING SYSTEM
================================================================================

Total Possible Score: 150 points
Minimum Acceptable Score: 50 points (33%)
Good Match Threshold: 70 points (47%)
Excellent Match Threshold: 100 points (67%)

================================================================================
SCORING FACTORS
================================================================================

Factor 1: Continuity Score (Maximum: 40 points)
------------------------------------------------
Definition: Has the patient been treated by this provider before?

Scoring:
- Patient previously seen by this provider: 40 points
- Treated same/similar condition previously: +5 bonus points
- No prior relationship: 0 points

Rationale: Continuity of care improves outcomes, builds trust, and
reduces need to repeat intake processes.

Example:
- Dr. Lee treated Maria 2 years ago for same knee → 40 + 5 = 45 points
- Dr. Ross never met Maria → 0 points


Factor 2: Specialty Match (Maximum: 35 points)
-----------------------------------------------
Definition: How well does provider's specialty match patient's condition?

Scoring:
- Exact specialty match (e.g., Orthopedic PT for knee surgery): 35 points
- Related specialty (e.g., Sports Medicine for knee): 30 points
- General PT with relevant certification: 25 points
- General PT without specific training: 15 points

Rationale: Specialized training leads to better clinical outcomes.

Example:
- Maria needs post-surgical knee rehab (orthopedic):
  * Dr. Ross (Orthopedic PT) → 35 points
  * Dr. Park (Sports Medicine + Orthopedic) → 30 points
  * Dr. Lee (General PT with orthopedic training) → 25 points


Factor 3: Patient Preference Fit (Maximum: 30 points)
------------------------------------------------------
Definition: Alignment with patient's stated preferences

Sub-factors:
a) Gender Match (15 points max)
   - Matches patient's gender preference: 15 points
   - No preference stated or not specified: 10 points (neutral)
   - Does not match preference: 0 points

b) Location Convenience (10 points max)
   - Same clinic location as before: 10 points
   - Within 5 miles of patient: 7 points
   - Within 10 miles: 5 points
   - Beyond 10 miles: 0 points

c) Age/Communication Style (5 points max)
   - Similar age range (±10 years): 5 points
   - Language match: 5 points
   - Otherwise: 0 points

Example for Maria (prefers female, familiar with Metro Main clinic):
- Dr. Ross (female, Metro Main, age 38): 15 + 10 + 5 = 30 points
- Dr. Lee (male, Metro Main, age 45): 0 + 10 + 5 = 15 points


Factor 4: Schedule Load Balance (Maximum: 25 points)
----------------------------------------------------
Definition: Provider's current capacity utilization

Formula: 25 × (1 - capacity_utilization)

Where capacity_utilization = current_patients / max_capacity

Scoring:
- 50% capacity (well-balanced): 25 × 0.5 = 12.5 points
- 60% capacity: 25 × 0.4 = 10 points
- 88% capacity (near full): 25 × 0.12 = 3 points
- 100% capacity (at max): 0 points

Rationale: Avoid overloading providers; ensure quality care.

Example:
- Dr. Ross: 15/25 patients (60%) → 10 points
- Dr. Park: 18/25 patients (72%) → 7 points
- Dr. Lee: 22/25 patients (88%) → 3 points


Factor 5: Day/Time Match (Maximum: 20 points)
----------------------------------------------
Definition: How well does provider's availability match patient's preference?

Scoring:
- Same day AND same time block: 20 points
- Same day, different time block: 15 points
- Different day within ±1 day, same time: 10 points
- Different day within ±3 days: 5 points
- Outside preferred window: 0 points

Time Blocks:
- Morning: 7:00 AM - 12:00 PM
- Afternoon: 12:00 PM - 5:00 PM
- Evening: 5:00 PM - 8:00 PM

Example for Maria (original: Tuesday 10 AM = Morning):
- Tuesday 10 AM available → 20 points
- Tuesday 2 PM available (Afternoon) → 15 points
- Wednesday 9 AM → 10 points
- Thursday 3 PM → 5 points
